check out waaave pool github
https://github.com/ex-zee-ex/waaaave_pool
on what you need to get set up
phosphorm can and will run without any kind of external DAC
but it is optimized to work with the hifiberry dac plus
if you download the files above and run on a waaave pool distro with an external DAC you will need to configure audio things on yr own!

and as always the simpler way to do things is just download, uncompress and use balena etcher to write one of these images to an sd card!

sorry no manual rn!  just try messing around with the kontrols tho and you'll see some cool stuffs.  the bottom 5 buttons on the bottom left hand side switch from different scales
default is 5et, then from left to right we have 7ET, 12ET, carlos alpha, carlos beta, and no scale at all
